# lkrg-bypass

The repository contains set of methods which I consider to be usefull to test LKRG protection against exploitation.

The history of researching of such methods started a year back with my the very first comment to LKRG community of how I see the LKRG protection can be bypassed:

There were few more discussions later:

Even though it was stated that LKRG is bypassable by design the project continues to be developed by it's main contrubutor Adam Zabrocki.

Personally, I found the LKRG source code very well written and I consider it as a great engineering project wich has an amazing integration into the low level kernel's stuff. I really appreciate Adam's effort he put to develop the project. It's an amazing example of how it's possible to develop a high quality out-of-tree kernel module which has so deep kernel intergation.
